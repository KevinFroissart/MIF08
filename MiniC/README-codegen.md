# Howto

`python3 MiniCC.py TP04/tests/provided/step1/test00.c --reg-alloc=naive`: launch the compiler and obtain a RISCV code with temp.

`make TEST_FILES="TP04/tests/provided/step1/*.c" tests-naive`: check expected and compile with the naive allocation.

`make TEST_FILES="TP04/tests/provided/step1/*.c" tests-notsmart`: check expected and compile with the naive allocation and the all in memory allocation.
