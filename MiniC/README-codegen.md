TODO for STUDENTS : Say a bit about the code infrastructure ...

# Howto

`python3 MiniCC.py TP04/tests/provided/step1/test00.c --reg-alloc=naive`: launch the compiler and obtain a RISCV code with temp.

`make TEST_FILES="TP04/tests/provided/step1/*.c" tests-naive`: check expected and compile with the naive allocation.

`make TEST_FILES="TP04/tests/provided/step1/*.c" tests-notsmart`: check expected and compile with the naive allocation and the all in memory allocation.

# Test design 

Tests are divided in 10 different folder.
Each folder is named after the functionality it tests.
Each folder contains a set of tests to test the expected 
behavior of both well written code and bad written one.
The relational test folder contains 6 other folders to
test each type of Conditions.
Eventually, a single test file at the root of 
the tests/students folder tests the ouf of memory case.
